# ⚡ Quick Action Required

## Node.js Not Installed Yet

The Node.js installer was downloaded, but you need to **run it manually** to install Node.js.

### 🎯 Do This Now (Takes 2 minutes):

1. **Open File Explorer**
2. **Go to your Downloads folder**
3. **Find the file**: `node-v24.13.0-x64.msi`
4. **Double-click it** to run the installer
5. **Click through the installer**:
   - Next → Accept → Next → Next → Install → Finish
6. **Close this terminal and open a NEW one**
7. **Come back and I'll run the app for you!**

## Alternative: Demo Version (No Installation)

While you install Node.js, I can create a **simple demo HTML version** that runs directly in your browser without any installation. It won't have the full backend functionality, but you can see the UI design.

Would you like me to create that demo version?

## After Installing Node.js

Just type "run" again and I'll automatically:
- ✅ Install all dependencies
- ✅ Start the backend server
- ✅ Start the frontend server
- ✅ Open it in your browser

**The installer is in your Downloads folder - just run it!** 🚀
