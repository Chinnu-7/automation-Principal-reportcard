# Setup Instructions - Node.js Required

## ⚠️ Node.js Not Found

To run this application, you need to install Node.js first.

### Quick Install Steps:

1. **Download Node.js**
   - Go to: https://nodejs.org/
   - Download the LTS version (recommended)
   - Run the installer

2. **Verify Installation**
   ```bash
   node --version
   npm --version
   ```

3. **After Installing Node.js, Run:**
   ```bash
   # Backend
   cd "d:\Automation of Report card\backend"
   npm install
   npm run dev

   # Frontend (new terminal)
   cd "d:\Automation of Report card\frontend"
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

### Alternative: Run with Python (Backend Only)

If you prefer Python, I can create a Python Flask backend instead. Let me know!

### What's Already Done:

✅ All code files created
✅ Database schema ready
✅ Frontend components built
✅ n8n workflows configured
✅ Documentation complete

### Just Need:

1. Install Node.js
2. Run `npm install` in backend and frontend folders
3. Start the servers

**Once Node.js is installed, let me know and I'll continue with the setup!**
